# Artificial Intelligence Engines

Computer code collated from various sources for use with the book: 

[Artificial Intelligence Engines: A Tutorial Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning](https://jamesstone.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/books/artificial-intelligence-engines)
 
**by James V Stone**

This file is: https://github.com/jgvfwstone/ArtificialIntelligenceEngines

Note that the book is principally about the mathematics of deep learning.
This repository is intended to provide 'taster' code, rather than an exercise in how to program deep learning networks. Because this code has been collated from different sources, the coding style varies between examples.

Each example has been reproduced with permission from the author.

**Downloading Single Files**

**System Requirements**

Each example has been tested on a mac (System Version:	OS X 10.11.3), MacBook Air 1.6GHz.
Python examples have been tested using the Spyder (3.3.2) python application with Python 3.7.0.
