# Artificial Intelligence Engines

Computer code collated from various sources for use with the book: 

[Artificial Intelligence Engines: A Tutorial Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning](https://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/AIEngines/)
 
**by James V Stone**

This file is: https://github.com/jgvfwstone/ArtificialIntelligenceEngines

Note that the book is principally about the mathematics of deep learning.
This repository is intended to provide 'taster' code, rather than an exercise in how to program deep learning networks. Because this code has been collated from different sources, the coding style varies between examples.

Each example has been reproduced with permission from the author.

**Downloading Single Files**

Github normally insists you download the whole repository.
However, to download a single file
1) go to the file so you can see it in the github user interface 
2) click on the RAW button in the upper right
3) use the browser "save as ..." menu to save the file to your computer. 

**How To ...**
There is a README file within each directory. 

**System Requirements**

Each example has been tested on a mac (System Version:	OS X 10.11.3), MacBook Air 1.6GHz.
Python examples have been tested using the Spyder (3.3.2) python application with Python 3.7.0.
MatLab examples have been tested using MatLab version 9.0.0.341360 (R2016a); no toolboxes are required.
